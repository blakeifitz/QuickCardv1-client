This is my first PERN application with full CRUD operations. This is the client side of the application and uses React with vanilla css. I am using React-Router for navigation, and a combination of context and state for UI/component management. There is smoke testing implemented for all components. A custom Fav Icon using favicon.io.


This project was created to shorten the time doing of doing a regular, helpful, repetitive job. I was inspired by a computers ability to do repetitive tasks exactly the same every time, and in an extremely short amount of time. For the next version I would like to improve my card creating algorithim, styling, and remove context from state management.
